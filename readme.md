# Jodie's Image Viewer 2 (jiv2)

Thought of a better method to display images in terminal in color and using braille characters.
As far as I know, this is the only terminal image viewer that does this. This is clearly better to me than any other method I've seen.

## Usage

```bash
jiv2 path/to/image.jpg [--width <width>] [--edges]
```

- the edges flag enhances edges
- the width flag sets the width of the image in characters (default is terminal width)
